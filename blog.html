      <p id="blog">I have never thought that programming would be something I would actually learn despite my fascination for it. It was for the extra intelligent people I knew and of course, a guy thing mostly. That was true until Google algorithms kept bringing articles upon articles about programming and how a “regular Jane” like me could learn it, get a freaking awesome job and change life’s path. That’s when I stumbled upon the Turing School of Software and Design and the decision to quit my job and study programming was made faster then I could plan how I would pay my bills during the 7 months that the classes happen. During the first module’s 6 weeks I got introduced to dozens of new words, several programming concepts, new thought processes, the true meaning of the word “grit” and the wonderful concept of “not yet”. It was an intellectual and emotional rollercoaster but it never crossed my mind that programming was not for me. Not a single time. So I swallowed my pride and redid module 1 and after another 6 weeks of the basics of Ruby and programming, I finally get it. Ruby is a beautiful language and coding is so even more fun! As a novice programmer overcomplicating methods and thoughts processes are a given so Ruby methods are my favorite “ingredient” of how to make “ruby magic” faster, better, more efficient and prettier. Every time I come across a new way to solve a problem I just stop and enjoy the beauty of it but not for long cause I can’t wait to find another beautiful method to learn.</p>
